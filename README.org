#+TITLE: My Firefox Profile
#+AUTHOR: Emermer
Includes customized user.js + extensions. Links to extensions below.

Profile (mostly) made by [[https://ffprofile.com/][Firefox Profilemaker]]

I also have a userchome.css, home page html file, as well as an autoconfig.cfg and autoconfig.js to use as extra settings for this profile, but they are not required. Those mentioned files are located [[https://github.com/Emermer/Mydotfiles/tree/main/firefox][here]].

NOTE: Upon loading the browser profile with these custom files, you may need to restart the browser for the settings to take full affect.
